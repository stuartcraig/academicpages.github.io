**Job Market Paper: Competition in Employer Sponsored Health Insurance: Implications for a Public Option**
<details>
<summary>
Abstract
</summary>
156 million Americans obtain health insurance through an employer. High premiums and concerns about access have led to proposals to introduce a "public option," where the government would provide a public insurance plan to compete with private insurers. In the absence of an existing public option to study, I combine data on employer-insurer contracting and a structural model of supply and demand to predict market outcomes under various assumptions about the design such a policy. The model incorporates variation in employers' demand for health care, preferences over insurers, and the degree to which employers find it costly to switch between insurers. Insurers set employer-specific premiums allowing them to price discriminate. I find that insurers' ability to price discriminate substantially limits demand for the public option that cannot. More employers abandon the private market when the public option successfully replicates the quality of existing insurers and more aggressively regulates payments to health care providers. However, even a public option that obtains substantial market share does little to lower markups because employers who remain privately insured strongly prefer their private insurer, have large switching costs, and receive risk-rated premium offers that dominate the premiums of the public option.

      We use insurance claims data for 27.6 percent of individuals with private employer-sponsored insurance in the US between 2007 and 2011 to examine the variation in health spending and in hospitals’ transaction prices. We document the variation in hospital prices within and across geographic areas, examine how hospital prices influence the variation in health spending on the privately insured, and analyze the factors associated with hospital price variation. Four key findings emerge. First, health care spending per privately insured beneficiary varies by a factor of three across the 306 Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) in the US. Moreover, the correlation between total spending per privately insured beneficiary and total spending per Medicare beneficiary across HRRs is only 0.14. Second, variation in providers’ transaction prices across HRRs is the primary driver of spending variation for the privately insured, whereas variation in the quantity of care provided across HRRs is the primary driver of Medicare spending variation. Consequently, extrapolating lessons on health spending from Medicare to the privately insured must be done with caution. Third, we document large dispersion in overall inpatient hospital prices and in prices for seven relatively homogenous procedures. For example, hospital prices for lower-limb MRIs vary by a factor of twelve across the nation and, on average, two-fold within HRRs. Finally, hospital prices are positively associated with indicators of hospital market power. Even after conditioning on many demand and cost factors, hospital prices in monopoly markets are 15.3 percent higher than those in markets with four or more hospitals.

**Vertical Integration and Control: Evidence from Medical Technology**<br>
_with Matt Grennan, Joseph Martinez, and Ashley Swanson_
<details>
  <summary>
    Abstract
  </summary>
Hospitals and physicians – which have historically acted as organizationally and financially distinct co-
producers of care – have become increasingly integrated in recent years. Firms’ stated objectives for
physician practice ownership have focused on sharing back-office functions, improving information flow,
and facilitating care coordination. However, recent evidence on physician-hospital integration suggests
that it primarily leads to higher prices and greater steering of patients to owning facilities, without
concomitant improvements in patient outcomes.
  
In this paper, we ask whether physician-hospital integration enables hospitals to resolve agency
problems between administrators and physicians, focusing on hospital purchasing of medical devices.
While hospitals negotiate prices for – and bear the cost of – implantable medical devices, at point of use
these products are selected by physicians whose choices may be price-insensitive due to brand loyalty
or inattention. These implantable medical devices account for 23 percent of hospital operating costs,
and prices vary widely across hospitals, suggesting large potential savings in the cost of health care
delivery. Hospitals’ seeking to negotiate lower prices through bargaining must be able to credibly
remove the supplier from its choice set, and hospitals and physicians often disagree about tradeoffs
regarding price and perceived quality across competing brands. Hospitals would prefer to procure those
brands that are cheapest, subject to meeting a basic quality standard. However, they must also cater to
the preferences of surgeons who may take their profitable procedures elsewhere.

This paper examines the possibility that hospital employment of physicians changes this paradigm. Using
machine learning algorithms, physician practice tax identifiers, survey data on hospital integration, and a
large sample of practices with validated integration, we find that physician integration in the U.S.
increased from 27% of physicians in 2008 to 45% in 2016, with significant variation across geographies
and specialties. We combine these physician integration data with unique hospital-level data on pricing
and utilization of medical devices, as well as data on procedural volumes. We ask whether hospitals and
health systems achieve lower costs in purchasing of medical devices after acquiring the practices of
surgeons who implant those devices. We then explore the extent to which savings are explained by
renegotiation of procurement contracts, holding utilization fixed, vs. utilization changes in the form of
standardization, brand switching, and expansion in procedure volume due to greater steering.
