I am currently a doctoral student at the Wharton School in the department of Healthcare Management and Economics. My research focuses primarily on bargaining in business-to-business markets, and has been feature in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/15/upshot/the-best-places-for-better-cheaper-health-care-arent-what-experts-thought.html">NYT</a>, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/health-cares-cost-conundrum-squared">New Yorker</a>, and <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/14/health-care/unprecedented-look-medical-costs-nationwide">NPR Marketplace</a>. In July 2021, I will be joining the Tobin Center for Economic Policy at Yale University as a Postdoctoral Associate.
