I am currently a doctoral student at the Wharton School in the department of Healthcare Management and Economics. My research focuses primarily on bargaining in business-to-business markets, and has been featured in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/15/upshot/the-best-places-for-better-cheaper-health-care-arent-what-experts-thought.html">NYT</a>, the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/health-cares-cost-conundrum-squared">New Yorker</a>, and <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2015/12/14/health-care/unprecedented-look-medical-costs-nationwide">NPR Marketplace</a>. My <a href="https://stuartcraig.github.io/research/">job market paper</a> studies whether a public option would increase competition in the market for employer-sponsored health insurance (see <a href="https://stuartcraig.github.io/research/">link</a> for abstract, draft coming soon). In July 2021, I will be joining the Tobin Center for Economic Policy at Yale University as a Postdoctoral Associate.
